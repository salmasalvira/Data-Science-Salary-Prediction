# Data-Science-Salary-Prediction
Dataset Sourse: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries.
The purpose of this code is to predict the data science salary value. I want to practice and see the output of using several regression models. I have not used the hyperparameter tuning yet for the model architectures, but will definitely use it later! :)
